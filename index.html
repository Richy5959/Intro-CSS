            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
                <li>Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer.</li>
                <li>Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
                <li>Melt the butter in a large frying pan and, as soon as the butter has melted, add the pancetta and garlic.</li>
                <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.</li>
                <li>Remove and discard the garlic, then take the pan off the heat.</li>
                <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.</li>
                <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
                <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesnâ€™t scramble.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.</li>
            </ol>
